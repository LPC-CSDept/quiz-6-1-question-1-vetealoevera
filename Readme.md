## Open the "q1.cpp"

> Complete the implementation of all functions

- Requirements

  - _**void swapTwoValues(int n1, int n2)**_ :  Two integer values are swapped
  - _**void swapTwoValues(float f1, float f2)**_ : Two float values are swapped
  - Make a _**main( )**_ to test the two functions with the user input values
    - make **getinput(int &, int &)** and **getinput(float &, float &)** to take user input with integer values or float values
    - Call each function with the appropriate data type arguments
    - after the function call, print out the values to check swapped values.
      - To print the float values, use " cout << fixed << setprecision(2)"

- - Program Source File:  Upload to the Github Classroom.
    - Link:
    - It will not be tested unless the filename is q1.cpp
  - Make sure that you pass all test units after commit/push.
    - Click the "XX Commits" in your Git Classroom Repository. Find the ✔️ mark in the Git history.
    - When you see the icon ❌ on the Git browser, fix your errors in your VS Code and then commit/push again.
    - There must be multiple times commit/push to pass all test units.
